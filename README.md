# Geyser Permission Blocker

A very simple extension that blocks all permissions for Bedrock players. This removes all 
base Geyser commands & extension commands from showing to players.

Users with the `permissionblock.exempt` permission - can be set by yet another extension -
will be excluded from this block. Console will remain to have access to all Geyser / extension commands.
